Replace the way that automorphisms are generated
Is much better to use the word approach and then generate the list of functions
to this I need the following functions:
ReduceAutomorphismWord, to reduce a word of automorphisms
AutomorphismFromWord, to create an automorphism from a word

For the second function I need to create a new object called the GroupOfAutomorphisms.
